# **NutriVision: Food Nutrient Analysis**

NutriVision is an AI-powered web application designed to recognize food items from uploaded images and provide their nutritional information. The application combines the power of deep learning and natural language processing to offer dietary insights based on the food identified.

---

## **Features**
- **Food Recognition**: Identify food items from images using a trained Food-101 model.
- **Nutritional Information**: Retrieve calorie, protein, fat, and carbohydrate details from the USDA FoodData Central dataset.
- **Dietary Insights**: Generate dietary suggestions using GPT-4 from OpenAI.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Simple and user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

## **Demo**
> _Add a link to your deployed Streamlit app here once live._

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Backend**: TensorFlow for image recognition, OpenAI GPT-4 for dietary insights
- **Datasets**:
  - [Food-101 Dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/food-101.tar.gz)
  - [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)
- **Dependencies**: TensorFlow, Pandas, Pillow, OpenAI API, Python-dotenv
