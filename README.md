NutriVision: Food Nutrient Analysis

NutriVision is an AI-powered web application designed to recognize food items from uploaded images and provide their nutritional information. The application combines the power of deep learning and natural language processing to offer dietary insights based on the food identified.

Features

Food Recognition: Identify food items from images using a trained Food-101 model.

Nutritional Information: Retrieve calorie, protein, fat, and carbohydrate details from the USDA FoodData Central dataset.

Dietary Insights: Generate dietary suggestions using GPT-4 from OpenAI.

Interactive Web Interface: Simple and user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

Technologies Used

Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: TensorFlow for image recognition, OpenAI GPT-4 for dietary insights

Datasets:

Food-101 Dataset

USDA FoodData Central

Dependencies: TensorFlow, Pandas, Pillow, OpenAI API, Python-dotenv

Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/NutriVision.git
cd NutriVision

2. Create a Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv nutrivision_env
source nutrivision_env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
nutrivision_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Add OpenAI API Key

Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

Alternatively, store your key using Streamlit Secrets Management for deployment.

Usage

Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run nutrivision_app.py

Upload a Food Image

Upload an image of food (e.g., pizza, burger, etc.).
